# Magento Block Comments

This adds a simple observer which surrounds block with comment tags to identify them rather than divs.

This has the benefit of not conflicting with the markup on the page, including popup/modal windows as well as showing more information which will help track down blocks in your layout files.

To install simply drop the app directory in the root directory of your Magento project.

Happy debugging! :)
